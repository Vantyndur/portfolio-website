                            I am a student of Information Technology at Częstochowa University of Technology. I will be
                            graduating in february 2026. I have choosen to develop a website in Flutter Web as my
                            Engineering Thesis, it is because I want to keep up with new technologies. I think it will
                            be a greate oportunity to learn something new and maybe some day use my knowledge in work. I
                            have an aspiration to become a greate coder and help people with my skills. I do not stick
                            only to the topic of applications development. I mix, enhance and create from sratch music
                            too. I have already used that skill to create some ringtones for my friends and mixed one
                            song for someones first dance at their wedding. The last one was a greate opportunity to
                            help somebody with my skills. I am a memeber of a rock band as well. The band is called "The
                            Clutches" and I am their bassist. In 2024 we have played as a support for a well-known band
                            called "Dżem". I can proudly say that standing on a stage in front of dozens of people is my
                            passion. When I see how much fun and happines flows from our songs to their hearts is making
                            my wanna jump to the crowd. I know how tough life can be and that is why I wanna help
                            everyone using technology to ease their lifes. I always try to stay positive and open for
                            people needs, even though people sometimes are rude to me. Maybe together we could make the
                            world a better place for everyone.

                            it due the fact that their contracts changed to open-ended contracts. I was to good for that

                            I was part of a 3 person team. I had to use GameMaker to create the game and the game size
                            had to not exide 5 MB. I have complitted all my tasks and ended with working, nice looking
                            game, but unfrotunately we did not win.
                            I was an awesome experience creating a game within a short period of time. It gave me the
                            knowledge how important is project managment and how little can be made with a pour one.
                            The first 3 days of total 14 days we tried to do something but it can be said thet we didn't
                            do anything, then I said to my colleges that we have to organize our work somehow. We tried
                            using Trello and it was a great idea. Our work speed exploded and we created a working game
                            in only two days. We frequently were checking our code and talking about what we have
                            achived so we exactly knew where we were. A good project managment turned out to be a
                            game-changer which made us confident to finish the game before deadline.
                            I would be happy to work on a new game again.
